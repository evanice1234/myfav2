    <p> My  Favorite hobby is coloring. It makes all black and white pictures colorful and bright! My favorite color is pink. So I like to color mostly everything in pink! When I was in 2nd grade I would come back home finish studyng and then start coloring. We had art class every friday. I like coloring sharks 
        and random imaginary bugs that I draw for fun.</p>
